About WinFellow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Welcome to the WinFellow Amiga Emulator, a software emulation of the Commodore
 Amiga computer system.
 WinFellow provides a virtual Amiga environment to your PC in which you
 can run Amiga software.
 The emulator runs on an IBM compatible PC with a Windows operation system
 installed.
 Different Windows versions can be used, the emulator has been tested successful
ly on operating systems ranging from Windows XP to Windows 10.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Commodore Amiga 500 model was used as a reference Amiga system when
 creating WinFellow, and the default emulator configuration aims at providing
 the speed and feeling of this particular Amiga system to your PC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
WinFellow is also highly configurable, advanced features can be enabled
 to provide more powerful capabilities that surpass those of a stock Amiga
 500.
 It is strongly advised to read the feature summary so you can get familliar
 with the strengths and limitations of the emulator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Amiga 500 computer was first released in 1987 as the successor for Amiga
 1000.
 It served for many years as the entry-level and the most popular member
 of the Amiga computer system family.
 With its rich multimedia capabilities thanks to several co-processors devoted
 to the generation of fast graphics as well as 4 channel sample-based stereo
 sound, it soon became a popular platform for games and demos.
 The advanced multimedia capabilities combined with a multi-tasking, window-base
d operating system made the Amiga well ahead of its time for a home computer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
WinFellow was created by Petter Schau; it is based on the Fellow Amiga Emulator
 for DOS, of which the first public version was released in December 1996.
 Leading up to the release there were several years of curious experimentation
 with methods to do fast emulation of selected parts in the Amiga hardware.
 Today it is a mostly complete software emulation of an Amiga 500 and beyond,
 thanks to the contributions of several other people.

Contributing to WinFellow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
WinFellow is developed by a team of volunteers in their spare time; you
 are very welcome to make contributions of your own.
 Contributions can be improvements to the code, new features, but can also
 include documentation updates or whatever else you feel could be an improvement.
 It is best if you find something you want to work on rather than mailing
 us and ask to be assigned a task.
 Since WinFellow is developed on an idealistic basis, the basic idea is
 that everyone should do something they like.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you start doing something it is wise to mail some of us in advance
 to make sure no one is doing double work.
 Since WinFellow is developed as open source software hosted on GitHub,
 it is easy to contribute.
 You can fork the source code of WinFellow, create a branch for your topic
 and start commiting changes to it; your changes can be submitted to our
 project in form of a pull request.
 Raising a pull request early on allows us to discuss your request early,
 so that we can see if/how your request may fit into WinFellow before you
 put any effort into it.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Part
System Requirements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
WinFellow is highly optimized for execution on low-end systems.
 It can be executed on any of the following operating systems:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Windows XP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Windows Vista
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Windows 7
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Windows 8 (including Windows 8.1)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Windows 10
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It does not have any particularly high CPU requirements, and should work
 well on any system capable of running one of these operating systems.
 However, for advanced features like 2x graphics mode, a relatively fast
 CPU will be required (a minimum of 2GHz is recommended).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Graphics card requirements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
DirectDraw
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Support for DirectDraw rendering is the default configuration, and is supported
 on all operating systems.
 For optimum performance, the graphics card should support DirectDraw hardware
 acceleration.
 Use is possible without, but performance will be reduced drastically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Direct3D 11
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Support for Direct3D 11 can be enabled in the display configuration settings,
 which enhances performance on systems that support it.
 It requires DirectX 11 to be installed, which is available for Windows
 Vista, 7, 8, 8.1 and 10.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For execution on Windows Vista, the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "platform update (KB971644)"
target "https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971644"

\end_inset

 should be installed, as it contains required updates to DirectX.
 The graphics card has to provide hardware acceleration for Direct3D.
 
\begin_inset Newpage pagebreak
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Part
Essential Requirements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before you can begin to use WinFellow, you will need two things: an Amiga
 Kickstart ROM, and a floppy image.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
ROM image
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
A copy of an Amiga Kickstart ROM, which is taken from a REAL Amiga.
 The Kickstart is copyrighted software and is not included with the emulator.
 This file can be extracted using a program called TransROM, which is included
 with WinFellow (Utilities
\backslash
Amiga).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The correct way to obtain this file is to copy it from the Amiga you own;
 you can also buy 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Amiga Forever"
target "http://www.amigaforever.com"

\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Cloanto"
target "http://www.cloanto.com"

\end_inset

 which contains licensed Kickstart ROM images and Workbench software prepared
 for immediate use with the emulator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Using TransROM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TransROM must be copied over to a real Amiga in order to extract a copy
 of the Kickstart ROM chip and capture it into a file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Example
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
CLI> transrom >RAM:kick.rom
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Will copy the Kickstart ROM chip and write it into a file in RAM: called
 "kick.rom".
 That file must then be copied to the PC and into the WinFellow directory
 (although it may be called from any different directory).
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Floppy image(s)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
You will also need an "image" of a real Amiga floppy disk, containing the
 program which you wish to run under WinFellow.
 This is obtained using a program called "TransDisk", and it is also included
 with WinFellow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A disk-image is a file in which the data normally stored on a floppy-disk
 is collected.
 A PC's floppy drive cannot read an Amiga floppy disk, so to be able to
 use WinFellow, you NEED a disk image of a real Amiga disk.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Using TransDisk 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like TransROM, TransDisk must be copied over a real Amiga to be of any use.
 TransDisk is run from the AmigaDOS shell prompt, and will copy a floppy
 disk, track by track, into a file (which can be read by WinFellow).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Example
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
CLI> transdisk >RAM:df0.adf
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Will make an image of any disk present in DF0:.
 The disk doesn't have to be named "df0.adf", you can use whichever name
 you feel is appropriate.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Copying Files From PC to Amiga & Amiga to PC
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
There are different options to transfer files between your Amiga and your
 PC.
 This list is by no means meant to be exhaustive, it just provides a few
 different options.
 With a little research, other ways may be possible or more fitting for
 your particular use case.
 Cloanto also kindly provides a few options 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "here"
target "http://www.amigaforever.com/kb/13-118"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Transfer vial terminal package and null-modem cable
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
If your PC is still equipped with a serial port, you can utilize a null-modem
 cable to perform a Zmodem transfer between an Amiga and a PC.
 Simply plug the cable into a serial port on each machine, load up a terminal
 package such as Terminus, NComm or Term on the Amiga, or HyperTerminal
 (if you are still on Windows XP) or an alternative like 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "RealTerm"
target "https://sourceforge.net/projects/realterm/"

\end_inset

 on the PC, and initiate a Zmodem upload on the Amiga.
 If you have it configured correctly (automatic ZModem download at the recieving
 end should be enabled), the PC will automatically accept this upload, and
 will download the software onto your PC's hard disk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For best results, obtain a copy of BaudBandit serial.device replacement for
 the Amiga, and set both ends to 57,600 Baud.
 BaudBandit should allow transfers of up to 5500cps to/from a 68000-based
 Amiga - it is available from AmiNET.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you're one of those people with an AmigaOS 1.2/1.3 A500, with only one
 floppy drive, you could be in trouble.
 Unless you have a Terminal package on a floppy disk which you can boot
 or use in a second drive, there's no way you can use a null-modem cable
 to talk to the PC (which is essential to actually get software like TransDisk
 or TransROM onto an Amiga floppy).
 Your best bet would be to approach an Amiga user group, who may be able
 to supply you with such a disk, or if you're lucky, an Amiga shareware
 house/distributor in your area.
 Note: Some Amigas permit you to lock the serial port at 115,200 baud.
 This largely depends on the machine, it's motherboard revision, and it's
 processor.
 By locking the serial port at 115,200 baud on both the Amiga and the PC,
 you can effectively transfer files over a null-modem cable at over 10,100cps.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
CrossDOS
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
If you don't have a null-modem cable, or don't particularly want to buy
 one, you can transfer the Amiga software over the PC using a 720k PC floppy
 disk.
 Workbench 2.1+ come bundled with CrossDOS, which is software which allows
 you to read PC 720k disks in your Amiga's floppy drive.
 If you don't have CrossDOS (i.e., you don't have access to Workbench 2.1 or
 higher), you can also use MessyDOS which is located at on Aminet.
 Here's a step by step guide on how to transfer software by floppy:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Obtain a 720k PC diskette.
 Format it either on your PC, or on the Amiga using CrossDOS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Create either an .ADF file or Kickstart ROM image using the method described
 above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Archive this file using either LhA or Zip (Make sure you have these on the
 PC, so you can unarchive them when you take the disk over).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Copy the archive to the 720k diskette, using CrossDOS or MessyDOS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Take the diskette over to the PC, copy the archive to the hard-disk, and
 unarchive it.
 Copy the Kickstart ROM image or .ADF file into the WinFellow directory and
 you're ready to go!
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Amiga Explorer
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Cloanto provides a shareware tool called 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Amiga Explorer"
target "http://www.amigaforever.com/ae/"

\end_inset

 that can also assist in the process, which provides more options to connect
 the systems; for example, it can be used with a Bluetooth serial adapter.
 Amiga Explorer is also included in

First Steps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This guide is going to take you through the first basic steps required to
 configure an emulation session using a ROM image and a boot floppy, showing
 you the most important configuration settings that you should be familiar
 with along the way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename Screenshots/main menu.jpg

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Above screenshot shows WinFellow's main menu.
 To get started, a number of settings should be configured.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can quickly select the disk images that are used in floppy drive DF0:
 to DF3: on this screen.
 Only floppy drives that are enabled in the configuration menu can be configured
 here; the green LED besides DF0: indicates that the drive is enabled.
 The red LED below the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button is the power led; the dark red tone in the screenshot it indicates
 that no emulation session is active.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Configuration of ROM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a first step, you should configure the ROM image that you want to use.
 To configure the ROM, you should click the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

configuration
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button, switch to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

memory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 tab and configure a ROM, like in the example below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename Screenshots/configuration - memory.jpg

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Click the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button besides image to open a dialog that allows you to select the base
 ROM image you have stored earlier; confirm that dialog by hitting OK.
 While on the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

memory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 tab, review the settings configured under 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

memory size
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is currently configured for 512KB chip memory size, as well as 512 KB
 bogo memory size, which is a pretty common setup.
 You can change these values individually, if you know that the software
 you are going to use has special memory requirements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Configuration of presets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to emulate a system based on a particular Amiga model, a quick
 way to get started is to utilize the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

presets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 tab:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename Screenshots/configuration - presets.jpg

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You first configure a ROM search path where WinFellow will automatically
 attempt to locate a matching ROM.
 You can then select a configuration from the dropdown list of emulated
 models; for example, you might select the Amiga 500 model with the popular
 A-501 expansion like shown above.
 After selecting a model, the most important settings for that model are
 shown in a preview below.
 WinFellow will attempt to locate the correct ROM for your selection automatical
ly.
 You can apply the settings shown in the preview to the active configuration
 by clicking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Apply Model Settings
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Configuration of floppy disks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Switch to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

floppy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 tab to configure the floppy disk images used by the emulation session:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename Screenshots/configuration - floppy.jpg

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can configure the image that is used by each of the four drives (DF0:-DF3:)
 in this dialog.
 Each drive can be enabled and disabled individually, and the disk image
 can be configured as read-only.
 Enabling 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fast disk-DMA
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can speed up the access to the emulated floppy disks.
 This setting however is not compatible with all software, you should test
 if the software you want to use supports it or leave it disabled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Configuration of display settings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While still in the configuration menu, switch to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

display
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 tab:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Review the display settings configured here.
 You can adjust the resolution of the emulation window to your preference
 by moving the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

resolution
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 slider.
 You can also enable full screen mode on this tab and configure the screen
 resolution.
 Depending on your screen size, it may make sense to configure the display
 size to 2x; you should adjust the resolution accordingly.
 When you are done, confirm your changed configuration settings by clicking
 the OK button.
 This brings you back to the main menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Input device focus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a few important key definitions you should be aware of when using
 a WinFellow emulation session.
 You will notice that the mouse cursor will disappear when you start the
 emulation session, and keyboard input will not appear on the Windows screen.
 This is because the emulation session takes control of your input devices,
 so that keyboard, mouse and possibly a joystick or gamepad are redirected
 to the emulated system.
 You can pause an emulation session and return to the main menu by pressing
 the 
\emph on
F11
\emph default
 key.
 You can toggle input device focus between an emulation session and Windows
 by pressing the 
\emph on
F12
\emph default
 key repeatedly; to give the focus back to the emulation session, ensure
 that the window is in the foreground and the mouse cursor over it when
 pressing 
\emph on
F12
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Starting and stopping an emulation session
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Click the button 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

start emulation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to start an emulation session.
 An additional window will appear hosting the emulation session; the virtual
 environment is now running.
 Go back to the main menu by pressing 
\emph on
F11
\emph default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Saving the configuration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, when in the main menu, open the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I can't get <put your favorite game or demo here> working.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many older games require special settings.
 Generally if having trouble check the following check-list:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
some Kickstart versions require special CPU models, so play around with
 reasonable combinations of them; for example it is a bad idea to run Kickstart
 1.2 on a '030 CPU
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
some games are written for a fixed amount of Bogo or Chip memory, so try
 setting them both to 512 kB or even disable Bogo memory completely
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
not all games behave nicely (some control the hardware directly) so that
 you may run into trouble when using things like "Fast Disk-DMA" or the
 immediate blitter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
many old games only make use of the first floppy drive and some do the strangest
 things when you try to use two drives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
timing may be critical, as some games do timing delays not by the timer
 but by delay loops; this will result in trouble when using CPU speeds other
 than the original 7 MHz
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If in doubt, use a default A500 setting like:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
68000 CPU at 7 MHz
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
1 floppy drive (disable the others!), leave "Fast Disk-DMA" unchecked
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
512 kB Chip and eventually 512 kB Bogo RAM

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If this configuration doesn't work and it's really an A500 game (not an
 AGA thing or such) it's possibly a WinFellow problem.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
I installed Workbench, but it refuses to load up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though it is possible to install Workbench into a directory, you must make
 sure that you install it into your hardfile or filesystem root directory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The keys O and P aren't working, why is this?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the 'enable autofire' is placed on those keys, the keys aren't used
 as input for the Amiga keybuffer.
 Just remove Keyboard Layout 1 from gameport 1 or 2 and the P and O keys
 will work again.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How to play games and run applications with WinFellow?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the general procedure to play a game or run applications on WinFellow:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
start WinFellow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
click on the configuration button
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
select the memory propertysheet
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
select a KickROM in the kickstart image edit control
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
click the OK button to return to the main window
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
select a ADF image containing your game
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
start the emulation by clicking start emulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's it, you should see the emulation window booting the KickROM (switching
 from dark gray, light gray to white) and then loading from the disk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Floppy disk images
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Floppy disk images are used to simulate floppy drives connected to the emulated
 Amiga.
 This is necessary, as a PC can't read Amiga floppy disks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Which file formats are supported?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
WinFellow supports *.adf disk images and the compressed *.adz, *.adf.gz or *.dms
 images; support for these is built into WinFellow, so you don't need any
 additional executables.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
ADF images
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Normal *.adf files are similar to a hardfile; they contain the contents of
 an Amiga floppy disk dumped into a file and thus are always 880 kb large
 for normal DD floppies.
 WinFellow can handle these without problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that there is also an "Extended" ADF file format, which is used for
 example by the game backups you can download from the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Factor 5"
target "http://factor5.de/downloads.shtml"

\end_inset

 homepage; these files contain some tracks which are specially encoded;
 you can recognize these easily by their file size, as they are always larger
 than 880 kB.
 WinFellow has limited support for these, and they worked fine in our tests.
 Should you experience any crashes if you attempt to use them, please let
 us know!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
ADZ and DMS images
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ADZ and DMS images may be regarded as normal ADF files that have been compressed
 to reduce their size; when inserting such files WinFellow decompresses
 them into a temporary ADF file, which is then used for your emulation session.
 Note that any changes saved to compressed images will be lost as soon as
 you quit the emulator.
 So to write changes to a disk decompress it manually before starting to
 work on it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
IPF images
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experimental support for *.ipf files (floppy disk images generated by the
 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Software Preservation Society"

\end_inset

) is available, but will only work in a few cases (the image must not be
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flakey
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which usually means copy protected).
 IPF images will only function when the user DLL from the IPF Support Library
 is downloaded and copied into the WinFellow directory.
 The Windows (32-bit) version 4.2 has been tested to work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Saving games doesn't work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When trying to save games there are some things you should take care of:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
make sure the savedisk file is not write protected (when copied from a CD-ROM
 to your HD the file ususally is write protected)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the file must not be compressed (see section about floppy image file formats);
 when saving to a compressed image, the changes are only saved to the uncompress
ed temporary image which becomes deleted when you quit the emulator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
take care of the compatibility information described in section 1.1; often
 savedisk problems go away when using a more compatible setting as disk
 access is always a time critical thing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
some games require savedisks to be formatted in a special way; sometimes
 a freshly formatted empty AmigaDOS floppy will do, sometimes you have to
 create a disk in the game; if possible, try using the savedisk that comes
 with the game or obtain a working one
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Filesystems and hardfiles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What are hardfiles?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of you probably already know this and may skip this paragraph.
 For the ones that are new to emulation here a short description: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A hardfile is used to simulate a harddrive connected to the emulated Amiga.
 Technically a hardfile is a 1:1 copy of the contents of an Amiga harddisk
 partition into a file.
 Having this in mind the restriction a hardfile has comes clear: a hardfile
 is of a fixed size and doesn't grow as it is written to (like perhaps the
 Amiga RAM disk).
 When creating a hardfile you have to specify the size the hardfile shall
 have, i.e.
 the amount of storage space you will be able to use on the simulated Amiga
 harddrive.
 This device supports all features a real Amiga harddrive has (so you may
 for example defrag it).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How do I use a hardfile?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First of all you need a hardfile that is to be used.
 Perhaps you already have one from UAE or DOSFellow; if you don't have one
 you may now create it in the configuration menu under the hardfile tab.
 Note that a newly created hardfile is just a file containing scratch; you
 need to format it on the Amiga side to be able to write any data to it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Add the hardfile to your config in the configuration menu's hardfile tab.
 Make sure that "Disable Autoconfig-devices" (section Various) is 
\series bold
not
\series default
 checked.
 The Autoconfig functionality is needed for the Amiga to automatically detect
 and initialize the device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also make sure you use a Kickstart version 2.0 or newer; with Kickstart 1.x
 the only way to use hardfiles is by the use of mount files (this possibility
 may be explained in more detail in a later version of this manual) and
 booting directly from them is not possible (since the old Kickstart versions
 don't support Autoconfig).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should now be able to use the file.
 If you have configured a newly created file, you should insert a Workbench
 disk file fitting the configured Kickstart, boot it and format the hardfile
 the way you want it (it will appear as FELLOW0).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you're going to use an already existing file (and this file is bootable,
 not only a data partition) eject all inserted floppy images and boot from
 it (again you should make sure the used Kickstart version fits the one
 the hardfile has been installed with).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Can I use my existing UAE hardfiles (*.hdf) with WinFellow?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yes, WinFellow and UAE use the same hardfile format.
 When using hardfiles generated by UAE, these must not make use of the Picasso96
 uaegfx-driver, as this one is not yet supported by WinFellow.
 It also must not make use of AGA screenmodes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Filesystems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What are filesystems?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like a hardfile, a filesystem is also used to simulate some kind of device
 connected to the emulated Amiga.
 But instead of using a file you configure WinFellow to use a directory
 on one your windows devices that shall be used to store or read data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This has the advantage that you don't have to care about the amount of data
 you want to store.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But this also has disadvantages: though on the first look the simulated
 device looks like a harddisk, it misses some features: formatting or defragging
 a filesystem device is absolutely impossible (and would not make sense
 either).
 To defrag it you'll have to run the windows defrag over the harddrive you
 stored the files on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another disadvantage lies in the differences between the Windows and the
 Amiga filesystem.
 The Amiga filesystem makes use of 8 different storage flags (e.g.
 executable, writable, ...).
 The Windows filesystem only supports 3 flags, but even these aren't really
 usable for this purpose so that actually only the windows archive flag
 is used to represent Amiga flags.
 For an Amiga, filenames like " " or "..
 " are fine; Windows runs into some serious trouble when you try to use
 such names.
 Just try to create a file named CON, then you'll know what I mean...
 ;)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get rid of this problem, a technique called fsdb (FileSystem DataBase)
 has been introduced in UAE (and WinFellow, as WinFellow uses UAE code for
 filesystem support).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every time a file has a name not supported by Windows, or uses flags that
 can't be stored, or has a comment, an entry for this file is created in
 a special database file.
 This file stores the local name, the according Amiga filename, the optional
 comment and the flags that are used.
 That way it is possible to use the device exactly the same way an Amiga
 device could be used, allowing to even boot from a filesystem (this was
 impossible without the fsdb).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why is all this relevant?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
WinUAE uses a slightly different way of storing the flag information, as
 it also utilizes the write-protection bit to represent the Amiga's writable
 and deletable flags; we do not think that this is the optimal solution,
 and thus implemented it another way.
 This means that the filesystem support from WinUAE is not necessarily 100%
 compatible with WinFellow's support.
 
\emph on
So be careful when exchanging data over a filesystem between them both
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How do I use a filesystem?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Configure the filesystem in the configuration menu on tab filesystem.
 You might also check "Automount Windows-drives"; this will automatically
 mount all hard disks, connected network drives and CD-ROMs as Amiga devices
 (so you don't have to configure anything manually).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Make sure that "Disable Autoconfig-devices" (section Various) is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 checked.
 The Autoconfig functionality is needed for the Amiga to automatically detect
 and initialize the device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As with hardfiles, ensure that you use a Kickstart version 2.0 or greater.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now you need something you may boot from.
 I suggest a Workbench disk or a hardfile.
 The device will appear under the name you configured.
 Install Workbench to the filesystem if you like and try booting without
 the floppy inserted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
GUI
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How can I play a game that has more than one disk / How can I switch a disk(imag
e)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can switch disks(images) at runtime in WinFellow.
 You can do this by pressing the function key <F11> during the emulation.
 After pressing the key you can see the main window again and this way you
 can change the disk(images).
 By clicking the "Start Emulation" button you can continue the emulation
 at the point before you pressed the function key.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Known Bugs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The player is invisible in <insert your favourite game here>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are certain games in which sprites aren't rendered correctly, resulting
 in invisible objects.
 Known games having this problem are Stardust, SuperFrog, Robocop 2, Zool,
 Alien Breed and Fire And Ice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The player doesn't collide with other game objects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not all collision types are properly implemented in WinFellow; for example
 in Transplant the spacecraft never collides with the rocks flying around.
 Known to have this problem is Transplant, but there probably are much more
 titles having this problem.
\end_layout

Module Ripper

\begin_layout Standard
Since many users asked about it the, old module ripper contained in the

source code, which also has some helpful information about various module
 formats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Supported Module Formats 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following formats are currently supported; more are probably to come
 later (we'll have to see the demand):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
ProTracker and clones (Protracker, Noisetracker, Startrekker 4/8 channel,
 ...) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
SoundFX 1.3 and 2.0 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
SoundMon 1.0, 2.0 and 2.2 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
FredEditor 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
ProRunner 2.0 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
ThePlayer 4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that while ProTracker files play fine in many music replayers like
 WinAmp, this isn't the case for the other more exotic formats.
 When you look for a good module player capable of playing all kinds of
 Amiga formats try XMPlay with the DeliX plug-in.
 DeliPlayer is an option is well, but is no longer under active development.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How to invoke the mod-ripper? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mod-ripper is a bit hidden in Fellow's integrated debugger.
 When running it, you are first prompted if you want to scan the emulated
 Amiga's memory for modules.
 This is the recommended way to rip modules; start the game or demo you
 want to rip the music from and when the song you want to rip is actually
 playing you may halt the emulation and run the mod-ripper to gather the
 song out of the memory.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other possible way is to rip from floppies; the module ripper detects
 when floppies are inserted and prompts you for each one if you want to
 rip from that floppy; this works ok with some games or demos that use custom
 trackloaders but will usually result in damaged modules when used on formatted
 AmigaDOS disks so that you have to be abit careful with modules ripped
 off a disk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
File naming conventions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whereas common module types like Protracker have a unique ending (*.mod),
 this is not the case for many other formats.
 For these, the ripper uses the default extension .cus to indicate a format
 that is not very widespread; these are the ones that won't play in most
 players so you'll need either a capable Amiga module player or a converter
 to play these.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Dump Chipmem option
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the debugger you also find a button "Dump Chip-memory".
 This may be used to save the contents of the whole chipmem into a file
 and so allows you to run other external module rippers over that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Final note 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The module ripper is in an experimental state.
 Should you experience issues with an exported file, send WinFellow's logfile
 along with a description of what you tried to rip music from (game/demo
 name) and the information the file save requester showed to

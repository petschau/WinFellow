Access API, Open License Agreement


PREAMBLE

This distribution (the package collectively referred to as the C.A.P.S.
"Access API") is to enable "plugin" support for C.A.P.S. media images,
where the actual C.A.P.S. library (which has its own license, and is
available separately from the website) may or may not be present.

It is intended for commercial (for-profit) applications, or those
applications that have a commerical version (for ease of transition)
that are not allowed to distribute the actual C.A.P.S. library as
defined by the license that comes with the C.A.P.S. library. For
freeware applications, it is better to use the C.A.P.S. API directly
and those applications can ignore this distribution entirely.

LICENSE

This distribution, the C.A.P.S. media "Access API" can be statically
linked to any program. No actual functionality is provided however.
For functionality, users need to download the complete distribution
from the C.A.P.S. website, and that distribution is bound by its own
license.

Commerical distributions of software products should make users aware
that they can enable C.A.P.S. media support by downloading and
installing the offical distribution from the website where appropriate.

The source code in this distribution should not be modified for obvious
reasons, however, this "Access API" package can used however
appropriate and this license need not be included with distributions
of the software product.

web site. Due notice shall be given if ever the license changes,

newer license.

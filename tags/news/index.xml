      <description>We sometimes get asked about older releases of Fellow for DOS as well as WinFellow, for a variety of reasons. As many of these are no longer readily available in a convenient location, we have decided to publish a few here. For this reason, a new History section has been established that you can visit in the menu at the top. The history section is a work in progress, let us know if you notice any issues or factual mistakes within it.</description>

      <description>New features:&#xA;re-designed display settings to make use of modern higher resolution displays more intuitive; instead of configuring a window resolution, scaling and overscan area can be configured automatically to create a window of the optimal size and scaling factor; both can also be configured manually to arrive at frequently window sizes support for the Direct3D 11 graphics API; this requires DirectX 11 to be installed on Windows Vista, the platform update KB971644 should be installed, as it contains required updates to DirectX the graphics card has to provide hardware acceleration for Direct3D ability to save screenshots to the pictures folder (hit &amp;lt; Print Screen &amp;gt; to trigger) support for automatic, as well as 3x and 4x scaling, which is useful for 4K/high DPI displays; for the best results, try leaving the scaling at automatic very basic serial port/UART emulation; nothing can be connected to the serial port; this is mostly used for serial debug logging (which is active only in debug builds of WinFellow), but the port is always being emulated Bug Fixes:</description>

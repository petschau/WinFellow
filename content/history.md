WinFellow is based on the Fellow emulator for DOS that was originally developed by Petter Schau in 1996, seeing its first release in 1997.
Fellow was initially developed using Watcom C++ 11.

The WinFellow project was initially hosted on SourceForge; [an archive of its original website from 2016 is still available](http://fellow.sf.net/new_version).
To travel even further back in time there is [an even older version of the website from 2001](https://fellow.sourceforge.net/old_version/main/index.html).

In 2016 the project moved to its current home on GitHub.
Older downloads are still available from the [SourceForge project files area](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fellow/files/WinFellow).

We sometimes get asked about older releases of Fellow for DOS as well as WinFellow, for a variety of reasons.
This chronological version history of Fellow and WinFellow highlights some of the early versions and important milestones.

Our old backup CD-ROMs have begun to dissolve, so it is becoming an issue to preserve those releases.

We want to provide access to some of the legacy versions of Fellow that are no longer available anywhere else.

This list is a work in progress; we do no longer have access to all of those builds ourselves, and some information may not be 100% reliable. The releases marked as - missing - could no longer be located by us.

If you have any corrections (like factually wrong or missing information), or if you still have access to some of the original files, we would be very grateful if you could [contact Torsten](mailto:torsten.enderling@gmail.com).

      <description>WinFellow is developed by a team of volunteers in their spare time; you are very welcome to make contributions of your own. Contributions can be improvements to the code, new features, but can also include documentation updates or whatever else you feel could be an improvement. It is best if you find something you want to work on rather than mailing us and ask to be assigned a task. Since WinFellow is developed on an idealistic basis, the basic idea is that everyone should do something they like.</description>

      <guid>https://petschau.github.io/WinFellow/history/</guid>
      <description>WinFellow is based on the Fellow emulator for DOS that was originally developed by Petter Schau in 1996, seeing its first release in 1997. Fellow was initially developed using Watcom C++ 11.&#xA;The WinFellow project was initially hosted on SourceForge; an archive of its original website from 2016 is still available. To travel even further back in time there is an even older version of the website from 2001.&#xA;In 2016 the project moved to its current home on GitHub.</description>

      <description>We sometimes get asked about older releases of Fellow for DOS as well as WinFellow, for a variety of reasons. As many of these are no longer readily available in a convenient location, we have decided to publish a few here. For this reason, a new History section has been established that you can visit in the menu at the top. The history section is a work in progress, let us know if you notice any issues or factual mistakes within it.</description>

      <title>WinFellow v0.5.4 released</title>
      <link>https://petschau.github.io/WinFellow/post/2017-03-11-winfellow-v0.5.4-released/</link>

      <guid>https://petschau.github.io/WinFellow/post/2017-03-11-winfellow-v0.5.4-released/</guid>
      <description>New features:&#xA;re-designed display settings to make use of modern higher resolution displays more intuitive; instead of configuring a window resolution, scaling and overscan area can be configured automatically to create a window of the optimal size and scaling factor; both can also be configured manually to arrive at frequently window sizes support for the Direct3D 11 graphics API; this requires DirectX 11 to be installed on Windows Vista, the platform update KB971644 should be installed, as it contains required updates to DirectX the graphics card has to provide hardware acceleration for Direct3D ability to save screenshots to the pictures folder (hit &amp;lt; Print Screen &amp;gt; to trigger) support for automatic, as well as 3x and 4x scaling, which is useful for 4K/high DPI displays; for the best results, try leaving the scaling at automatic very basic serial port/UART emulation; nothing can be connected to the serial port; this is mostly used for serial debug logging (which is active only in debug builds of WinFellow), but the port is always being emulated Bug Fixes:</description>
